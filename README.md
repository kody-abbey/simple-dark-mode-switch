## ✨ Overview

Minimal Dark Mode is a simple browser extension that forces websites into a dark color scheme.

It focuses on:

- ⚡ Extremely lightweight performance
- 🎯 Simple and universal behavior
- 🔧 Minimal configuration
- 📖 Comfortable long-time reading

This extension intentionally prioritizes speed and simplicity over perfect visual compatibility.

## 🚀 Features

- Toggle dark mode ON / OFF

- Applies dark background and light text across most websites

- Very small resource usage

- No tracking, no analytics, no external requests

## 🧠 Philosophy

Many dark mode extensions try to perfectly redesign websites.

This extension takes a different approach:

Make websites darker quickly and efficiently, even if layout imperfections remain.

## 🖱 Usage

1. Install the extension

2. Click the toolbar icon

3. Toggle dark mode ON / OFF

That’s it.

## ⚠ Limitations

Because this extension applies generic CSS rules:

- **Some websites may have visual inconsistencies**

- Certain elements may not follow site-specific themes

- Complex web apps may partially ignore styling

These are intentional trade-offs to keep the extension lightweight.

## 🔒 Privacy

### Privacy Policy

This extension:

- Does NOT collect any data

- Does NOT track browsing history or store browsing logs

Only modifies page appearance locally
